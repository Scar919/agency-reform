## Technology Used 

HTML

Git 

## Description 

The motivation behind creating this project was to meet webpage accessibility standards. I wanted to make this website more accesssible and user friendly. In order to do just that, I had to restructure a large amount of code, as well as use semantic HTML elements within the new structure. Not only did I restructure the HTML elements, but as well as the CSS elements.

## Usage 

With the website being more user friendly and accessible, it is easier to navigate down through each tab by clicking on the options on the top left margin. Instead of needing to scroll down to read the details of the webpage, each title will navigate you to the correct place within the webpage.

## Learning Points 

In finishing this project I've learned how important it is to keep work in an organized and sequential order. Not only does keeping the work organized make it easier for oneself and their team, if working with a group, but it also makes content/webpages easier to navigate through for a user.
